## Featured Projects

### [fakr-cli-framework](https://github.com/LogoASeguir/fakr-cli-framework)
A self-learning local runtime connected to AI API keys that turns conversations into reusable knowledge (skills, patterns). Tracks design choices (embryo), obeys user choices (contracts), and builds a growing memory layer.

### [moment-editor](https://github.com/LogoASeguir/tool-moment-editor)
Desktop tool for editing and organizing video/audio moments with precise timestamp control and non-destructive workflow.

### [project-compiler](https://github.com/LogoASeguir/tool-project-compiler)
CLI utility that compiles project scripts into a single usable .exe — perfect for testing (locally).

### [local-git-manager](https://github.com/LogoASeguir/tool-local-git-manager)
Batch git operations across multiple local repositories from one interface.

 I'm learning by doing. AI is mostly for research, brainstorm, QA and small debugging queries.
